# Useful Scripts Collection
In this repository I'll share with you some small (or not) script that help me in my daily work routine and might help you too! :smile:

# Available Scripts
## Commit

This is just a small script written in Bash that helps you manage your commits and pushes to the Git server.

It's a quite simple script but allows me to save a few lines of commands, just that stupid. :smile:

I've tested this in:
- Mac OS X

### Instructions

- Download the script to your computer
- Type "mv commit /usr/local/bin && chmod +x commit" (That way you don't need to modify you PATH variable :smile: )
- To start using all you must do is type the following command:
    - commit . "Commit description here" push <- the . (dot) refers to the directory you want to commit
- If you want to commit but you don't want to push your changes yet:
    - commit . "Commit description here" <- the . (dot) refers to the directory you want to commit

Not at all. Suit yourself!

Sure! Just open a PR :raised_hands:
